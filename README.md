xml-schema-v1.1
===============

Sample to validate XML with an XML Schema 1.1 and Xerces 2. This sample tests simple assert and alternative 

Xerces 2 is still maintained. Checkout and build the code at:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/xerces/java/branches/xml-schema-1.1-dev/

It is important to use the library available in: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/xerces/java/branches/xml-schema-1.1-dev/tools/

And especially Eclipse PsychoPath (org.eclipse.wst.xml.xpath2.processor_...) which is used for xpath 2.
 
dependencies have system scope for the ease of use of this sample. Take care, most of them are not available on maven central.
